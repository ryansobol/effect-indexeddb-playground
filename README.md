# effect-indexeddb-playground

A work-in-progress [experiment](index.ts) that wraps Effect.ts over IndexedDB.

- [Effect.ts](https://effect.website/)
- [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.21. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
